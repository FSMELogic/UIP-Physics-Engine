Unified Information Potential (UIP) Theory**.   The theory posits that spacetime is not an empty void, but a fluid-like medium with a fundamental **Vacuum Stiffness Constant** ($\alpha \approx 0.35$). This constant acts as a universal speed limit for information density, governing phenomena from the quantum scale to the galactic scale.
